			 * The mcgyverism here in order to make this thing work is the following:
			 * We consider that the cost to traverse an edge, that is, the tranmission time between nodes,
			 * is practially always the same (And indeed it is, because according to our simultion logs, such transmission
			 * time is almost always the same, for all nodes).
			 * 
			 * In similar terms to Djikstra, the getShortestDistance method returns the accumulated weight from a node, and the
			 * getDistance(node, target) method returns the edge weight, which, in our implementation, is the lower bound of the
			 * time interval within the edge, meaning it refers to the starting time of the interval
			 * 
			 * Initially, source node's weight is 0, and every other node has INFINITY as their weight.
			 * During this relaxation phase, we verify if the destination node's weight (In other words, a neighbour node) is bigger than
			 * the distance it takes to reach it. If it is bigger, we set this target node's weight with a smaller value, that is, the
			 * value of the edge which reachs it.
			 * 
			 * In practical terms, we are always seeking, the path which takes from a node to another within the earliest possible time,
			 * which means that, one node will not necessarily send a message through the first edge it connects to, because if it waits
			 * for an opportunity to connect with a more suitable node, and edge, the message may arrive eariler to the destination node.
			 * 
			 * In our workaround, we always take into consideration, for the weight calculation, the  lower bound of the edge's time
			 * intervals, because the transmission speed is always big enough to ensure the message will be successfully transmitted to
			 * another node BEFORE the pair of nodes disconnect, that is, reaching a time greater than the connection interval's
			 * upper bound.
